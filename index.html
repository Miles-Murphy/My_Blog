                    <h3>Wow - I have been lazy AF, at least when it comes to this blog!</h3>
                    <time datetime="2020-09-27T21:04">September 27, 2020</time>

                <img src="images/murder-mystery-party.jpg" alt="My one break from social distancing took place in a small-scale murder mystery party with some friends who have also been strict with social distancing!"style="width:225px;height:300px;">

                <p>Apparently all it takes is one hurricane and I forget a blog and focus on life/studying, without documenting it. I have not stopped my Udacity training, but I have simply been too busy or too tired to work on the blog outside of the time I have already been spending on studying. This is changing now, but geez, September and August have just been a blur. Election chaos has further gripped the county, all of my friends and family are finally stircrazy from a summer of isolation. Thankfully, none of them have been taking unnecessary risks with the pandemic, but now people are starting to come out of their shelters. American football is back, but how long will it last? Notorious RBG has passed and left a critical hole in the Supreme Court. Over 25 named storms have developed in the Atlantic. Honestly, what else can happen in 2020?
                </p>
                <p>Despite all the chaos, I am somehow continuing with my Nanodegree with Udacity. Compared to April, I am a python/SQL savant. However, I see  nothing but gaps in my knowledge as I progress further into the Data Anlysis portions. I struggled through the statistics portion and am now preparing to start the Data Wrangling portion. I just received the approval for my Twitter API access, so now I have nothing holding me back but my apprehension. Despite all of my efforts I still feel as though I am barely treading water. I am really starting to think about my next career steps and how I translate this training into convincing someone I can actually learn/train to be a successful Data Analyst. I am signing up for the career coaching services and working on my resume to try and blend my skills as a policy expert and a data analyst.</p>
                <p>Lastly, I have to unfortunately report that the road trip is currently on hold. My wonderful partner has been working nonstop in Texas to help them weather the pandemic, but unfortunately, due to a lack of belief in the virus and regulations to prevent its spread, Texas is seeing consistent cases and hospitals remain at high capacity and understaff. Hopefully she will be able to step away from this assignment soon, but there is no timeframe. Which is both good and bad. I have more time to focus on my projects for Udacity and study/train for potential career moves. However, I also am still very much alone as I social distance. Thankfully, I am still sane, but we will have to see how long that lasts.</p>

                <p>Now, this past weekend was actually productive. While I did nothing on Saturday, Sunday was remarkably productive. I think I will be starting the project by the end of this week, giving myself just under 3 weeks to complete it! It is due August 25th to "stay on schedule." I really need to do that, because I am going to lose a lot of time eventually when the road trip from Seattle to Wilmington finally happens.
                </p>
                <p>I did not do nearly enough during the week last week, as I realized that I was less than 30 miles to 100 miles for the month of July! I ran ~30 miles in 5 days to end the week. It caused a very lazy Saturday, but I am proud to have accomplished it given just how HOT July has been. Now, I can go back to a normal running schedule and make sure that I am getting in 1-1.5hrs of Udacity work every evening!
                </p>
                <p>This program is moving fast and I am not memorizing formulas and functions, but rather I am learning how to think about the data and then go find the methods I need to make the data look nice. I know I am capable of being a Data Analyst, but it will take a lot of repition and a job opportunity which will be educational and a little forgiving early on. For now, it is just a lot of hard work!
                </p>

                    <h3>Oh, How I Didn't Miss Feeling Overwhelmed: Back to Learning Python!</h3>

                <p>This past weekend was a blur. I was unfortunately forced to tackle some housework which I left to stack up. My roommate moved out and did very little to clean and I simply had to deal with the mess before I could relax or study! Between cleaning, running, yoga, and cooking, it is a wonder that I found the time to finish my first project for Udacity's Data Analysis course (and pass!) and complete the first two lessons of the "Introduction to Data Analysis" portion.</p>
                <p>However, here is where it became a little more challenging. I welcome back the instruction of Juno Lee. She is a fantastic teacher, but Udacity moves quickly and for those of us who have little to no prior programming experience, it can be a bit daunting. I value the videos, examples, quizzes, and lessons, but I often find myself doing a lot of additional research or Googling to figure out answers! I am definitely becoming more comfortable, but it does make me wonder if I will ever really be able to find, let alone keep, a job in Data Analysis.</p>
                <p>I also discovered that I am only 25 miles away from running 100 in July. Between the heat, work, and Covid19, that would be an impressive number. However, 4 days and 25 miles, during the work-week will be a bit daunting. I may need to do some 2-a-day runs so I can get enough mileage in without dying in the heat! We will see if I can make it work and still keep up with my studies too!</p>

                <p>I did not make a lot of headway on the project this evening, because I was a little too busy celebrating Liverpool's official trophy ceremony for their incredible Premier League win!</p>
                <p>I did work in Excel quickly to create the line graphs required for the project. I have decided that I will complete the project quickly, so I will not get behind in lessons. However, I will slowly try to build a program (similar to the first class's Bikeshare Project) which will provide some insights into the temperature data and try make some comparisons between cities. We will see how it goes.</p>

                    <h3>Learning Something New</h3>

                <img src="images/numpy.png" alt="The logo for NumPy, the python library I have been studying the last few days to build my own running average function."style="width:100px;height:100px;">

                <p>The first project for this class could not be more simple. Use basic SQL language to select data for city and global avgerage temperatures and then use Excel or another common software to analyze them for running averages. However, since I have 2 weeks to finish the project and still be on time. I have decided that I am at least going to try to utilize NumPy (and maybe Pandas as well) to develop a python program which would read this csv data I have collected, compute the running averages the project requires, and compare various features about the data.</p>
                <p>I know what I am proposing is very doable, it just may not be time efficient for someone new to programming who is on a deadline for a four month class. If I do not have a good framework set up by the weekend, I will pass the project using Excel and maybe work on this function as a side project in my free time. (What free time? Good question!🤦)</p>
                <p>In other news, North Carolina saw it's highest new daily Covid19 case numbers on the 18th and Liverpool only has two games remaining. Both of these are quite alarming and I hope only one of them is still around in the fall! Well, maybe Covid19 will decide to take the fall off, but I highly doubt it given the way the USA is behaving. </p>

                <p>Today, while a friend is off on a date and my significant other is busy treating Covid patients in TX, I enrolled in the 2nd class of the Programming for Data Science: Data Analyst Udacity Nanodegree. I took more time off than I indended, but the end of June/beginning of July have just been nonstop. Apparently even a pandemic cannot slow down a beach town in summer.</p>
                <p>It was nice to refresh my SQL skills almost immediately. I know that one of the key components of a successful career in Data Analysis is the ability to search out and find the information you need to properly compose your queries. You cannot remember every rule or function in any programming language, so being able to efficiently find and adapt information to help write your code is very important. Soon we will find out whether Raleigh, NC is seeing more, less, or not significant changes in temperature compared to the Global Avg. I look forward to utilizing my whole repertoire of skills from the Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree.</p>
                <p>Also, Man City lost to Arsenal 2 to nil in the FA Cup Semifinals and I could not be more shocked. Apparently Arsenal decided to save their best football of the year for the last 4 games of their season! Anyways, lets hope the Reds wake up and finish strong against Chelsea and New Castle! You'll Never Walk Alone</p>

                <p>The time has come for a change. I have known that significant paradigm shift is required in my life, but I have lacked the courage, motivation, and target. Recently, after several new life experiences, I have come to the conclusion that I would like to be working in an industry which has flexibility and will enable me to support everyone in my life, not just those who happen to be within an hour of where I live.</p>
                <p>My current role in Local Government is locally flexible. I can easily leave early for a dentist appointment. However, it has no sense of the larger world outside of its county. With a traveling partner, eldery parents, and multiple friends in foreign countries, I need the ability to work wherever it is convenient that day. That is why I have already completed one Nanodegree with Udacity and will be starting my second on the path to learning more about Data Science and becoming a Data Analyst.</p>
