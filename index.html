                <p>Today, while a friend is off on a date and my significant other is busy treating Covid patients in TX, I enrolled in the 2nd class of the Programming for Data Science: Data Analyst Udacity Nanodegree. I took more time off than I indended, but the end of June/beginning of July have just been nonstop. Apparently even a pandemic cannot slow down a beach town in summer.</p>
                <p>It was nice to refresh my SQL skills almost immediately. I know that one of the key components of a successful career in Data Analysis is the ability to search out and find the information you need to properly compose your queries. You cannot remember every rule or function in any programming language, so being able to efficiently find and adapt information to help write your code is very important. Soon we will find out whether Raleigh, NC is seeing more, less, or not significant changes in temperature compared to the Global Avg. I look forward to utilizing my whole repertoire of skills from the Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree.</p>
                <p>Also, Man City lost to Arsenal 2 to nil in the FA Cup Semifinals and I could not be more shocked. Apparently Arsenal decided to save their best football of the year for the last 4 games of their season! Anyways, lets hope the Reds wake up and finish strong against Chelsea and New Castle! You'll Never Walk Alone</p>

                <p>The time has come for a change. I have known that significant paradigm shift is required in my life, but I have lacked the courage, motivation, and target. Recently, after several new life experiences, I have come to the conclusion that I would like to be working in an industry which has flexibility and will enable me to support everyone in my life, not just those who happen to be within an hour of where I live.</p>
                <p>My current role in Local Government is locally flexible. I can easily leave early for a dentist appointment. However, it has no sense of the larger world outside of its county. With a traveling partner, eldery parents, and multiple friends in foreign countries, I need the ability to work wherever it is convenient that day. That is why I have already completed one Nanodegree with Udacity and will be starting my second on the path to learning more about Data Science and becoming a Data Analyst.</p>
